# Imagify

Imagify is a React + Vite front-end for generating and managing images. It includes authentication flows, pricing and profile pages, a simple image-generation UI (client-side fetch to a public image endpoint), Redux Toolkit state management, toast notifications, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Key features

- Image generation UI (client-side prompt → image via Pollinations endpoint).
- Authentication flows: login, forgot password, OTP verification, reset.
- Protected routes for authenticated-only pages (e.g., `/image-generate`).
- Pricing and profile pages, with user credits and plans displayed.
- Global state with `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`.
- UI primitives using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI patterns.

Tech stack

- React 18
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
- Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-redux`)
- Radix UI (`@radix-ui/react-slot`, `@radix-ui/react-toast`)
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Optional: `openai` is listed as a dependency for possible OpenAI integration

Repository structure (important files)

- `src/App.jsx` — App root and router configuration (routes: `/`, `/image-generate`, `/pricing`, `/profile`, plus auth routes).
- `src/main.jsx` — app entry, Redux `store` provider, and `RouterProvider`.
- `src/component/ImageGenerate.jsx` — simple image-generation UI that fetches from `https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/<prompt>`.
- `src/component/Header.jsx` — top navigation with login/logout, user menu and credits.
- `src/components/ui/` — shared UI primitives (`button.jsx`, `toaster.jsx`, etc.).
- `src/utils/` and `src/lib/utils.js` — utility helpers, slices (`toggleSlice.js`, `userSlice.js`) and store setup.

Getting started

Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS) and npm or yarn

Install dependencies

```powershell
cd d:\React\Imagify-main
npm install
```

Run development server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Environment & configuration notes

- The code references a `BASE_URL` constant and makes authenticated API calls (see `src/component/Header.jsx`). For full authentication and image generation with protected APIs (OpenAI), add a backend or environment variables to securely store API keys and session cookies.
- By default, the `ImageGenerate` component uses `https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/<prompt>` which is a public image endpoint; replace this with your own image-generation backend or OpenAI integration for production-grade usage.

Routing

- `/` — Home / Body
- `/image-generate` — Image generation (protected)
- `/pricing` — Pricing page
- `/profile` — User profile (protected)
- `/forgot-password`, `/verify-otp`, `/reset-password` — password flows

Development notes

- State management is in `src/utils/store` and related slices in `src/utils/`.
- Toasts use a custom `use-toast` hook and Radix `Toaster` component.
- UI components follow a variant-driven approach (see `src/components/ui/button.jsx`).

Testing & linting

- Linting: `npm run lint` (ESLint is configured).
- There are no automated tests included by default; consider adding Jest or Vitest for unit tests.

Contributing

- Open an issue or pull request describing your changes.
- Keep changes focused and add documentation for new features.

License

- This repository does not include a license file. Add an appropriate `LICENSE` if you plan to publish or share the code.

Contact / Next steps

- To fully enable image generation with OpenAI, add a server-side endpoint that accepts prompts and calls the OpenAI Images API securely (do not expose API keys on the client).
- If you want, I can:
  - add an `.env.example` showing needed environment variables,
  - wire a small Express or Vite server endpoint proxying requests to OpenAI, or
  - open a PR with the README committed.
